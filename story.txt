Once upon a time, deep in the darkest of woods, lived a dragon. Nobody dared
near the forest, for fear of being eaten alive. Whenever little children caused
trouble, their parents warned them that if they did not behave, the dragon would
come and eat them. As such, the dragon saw very little of humanity, and humanity
saw very little of it.
