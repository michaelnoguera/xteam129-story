Once upon a time, deep in the darkest of woods, lived a dragon. Nobody dared
near the forest, for fear of being eaten alive. Whenever little children caused
trouble, their parents warned them that if they did not behave, the dragon would
come and eat them. As such, the dragon saw very little of humanity, and humanity
saw very little of it.

One day, a little boy went into the forest followed a beautiful butterfly. When the dragon saw him, it was confused that the boy was so brave to approach, so he asked:"Do you know who I am?"

"Of course."The young boy answered.

The dragon was shocked by this boy.

The boy was unafraid.  The dragon had never met someone who did not cower in fear from him.

The dragon thought to himself, "Was this refreshing? Was this disrespectful?"

The boy interrupted his train of thought, "I just wanted to tell you that you are more beautiful than this buttefly that I was following!"

The dragon reared back in surprise.  "A dragon -- beautiful? I am supposed to be fearsome!"

The boy replied, "Why can't you be both?"

And so began the beginning of a lifelong friendship.
